Is it weekend yet?
===================

A simple page showing a progress bar to indicate when you can open your Friday
beer with good conscience. It also gives some constructive hints when the
weekend is far away, which would be: *get back to work!*.

Opera Speed Dial Extension
--------------------------
If you execute the Makefile it will generate
[WeekProgressBar.oex](http://erikschlyter.github.com/WeekProgressBar/WeekProgressBar.oex).
If you run Opera 11.50 you can install it and have the progress bar running
continuously within your Speed Dial. 

More info about Speed Dial Extensions can be found at
[dev.opera.com](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/creating-opera-speed-dial-extensions).

W3C Widget
----------
The Makefile will also generate
[WeekProgressBar.wgt](http://erikschlyter.github.com/WeekProgressBar/WeekProgressBar.wgt),
which can be installed in Opera and thereby be executed as a standalone
application. More useful Widgets can be found at
[widgets.opera.com](http://widgets.opera.com).
